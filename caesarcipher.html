<h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
<p>
	The Caesar Cipher is among the oldest ciphers that is still known today. Essentially, Caesar and his generals would agree on a number between one and twenty-six in confidence (henceforth referred to as x) before parting. Then, to encipher a message, they would substitute each letter in the message with the letter that was x letters farther in the alphabet. In this way, the messages could be sent and be unintelligible to the enemy.
</p>
<p>
	These functions take two arguments, a number and a message, and enciphers the message using that number as the "jump number". In this way, messages can be sent confidentially. This is, however, not a strong method of encryption, and can be easily deciphered with enough time and computing power. Have fun!
