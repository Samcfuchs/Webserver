<h3>About this site</h3>
<h4><b><i>If you have not been invited to this site, please leave so that there is less traffic for legitimate users. Thank you.</i></b></h4>
<p>
	This site is the host for all of my major projects and programs. It's now accessible to anyone with its IP address, which could create problems with traffic, if it got out of control. It's now running on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B! This is running the most recent release of Raspbian, which handles it relatively well, but probably couldn't deal with much traffic. For this reason, it is crucial that this IP remains private. I've added CSS and Javascript, but there's not much there yet.
</p>

<h3>The Next Step</h3>
<p>
	This site is not likely to change all that much in the near future. I've added most of the features and framework, and I now only have to add content. I've been reading about JQuery, and if I learn anything from <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, I might give it a shot on this page, for its own sake.
