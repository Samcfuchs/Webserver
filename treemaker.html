<h2>Directory Tree Maker</h2>
<p>This is just a simple program I wrote in a batch script. It creates a huge (collossal) tree of folders, nested within one another. It creates a folder for each letter of the alphabet, then mirrors that within each of those folders. Thus, it creates an exponentially increasing number of folders for each level it goes through. As of right now, it's only available for Windows, in the .bat format, but I do plan on making a Linux version, probably in the .sh format. Be careful when using this, because if you open it in the wrong place, it will explode, and it takes a <em>very</em> long time to remove all of them. The version that I currently have running creates 456,976 folders in total (26^4). This is more than enough to hide whatever you wish, and I don't think I'll go bigger, as this one already takes hours to complete. Also in the future is likely a tree remover, which would be faster than trying to delete with the Windows method. Until I make one of these, keep in mind that when you run the script, it makes 26 folders in whatever location you run it in.
